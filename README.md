# tc39-proposal-dotstructuring
## Proposal: Object dotstructuring (dot property access + destructuring)

This proposal is also known as: Pick Notation, Extended Object Destructuring, Extended Dot Notation.
Inspired by Bob Myers' [proposal](https://github.com/rtm/js-pick-notation).\

This is a proposal to allow read and write operations of multiple properties from objects, leveraging object destructuring syntax to support renaming and defaults.
